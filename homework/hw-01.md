Homework 1
================

## Getting started

In order to configure your machine to run both R and Python, you’ll need
to do the following steps:

1.  Download and install R (or update if you already have it)
2.  Download and install RStudio (or update if you already have it)
3.  Download and install the `reticulate` package.
4.  If it doesn’t prompt you to install miniconda, run
    `reticulate::install_miniconda()`.

If you have issues running Python commands from an Rmarkdown file,
please come by office hours or get in touch with me.
