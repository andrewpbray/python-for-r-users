1. Consider the list `l = [2, 8, 45, 11, 5, 0]`. Check whether each element in the list is even and return the result, either true or false, using ...
    1. a `for` loop where your assign your variable to take the *index* of the loop,
    2. a `for` loop where you assign your variable to take the *values* in the list directly, and
    4. Also implement this in R.
    
1. Consider the lists `animals = ["penguins", "turtles", "dragons"]` and `foods = ["sandwiches", "ice cream", "tacos"]`. Use two for loops, one nested within another, and assigning the variables to take the *values* of the lists, to print the full set of sentence combinations of the form `"penguins love sandwiches", "penguins love ice cream", ..., "turtles love tacos".

1. Repeat this exercise but this time use a single for loop where the variable takes the *index* of the loop.
    
1. We saw in lecture that Python has a structure called an *iterator* that acts like a list for the purpose of iteration, but it doesn't actually allocate that full list. The example we saw was `range()`. Use the `enumerate()` iterator (see p. 55 in *Whirlwind*) to print out the index of the elements of `l`, their value, and if they're even.

1. Although the result won't be quite the same, repeat exercise 2 using the `zip()` iterator (see p. 56 in *Whirlwind*).

1. In R, create a simple linear model using whatever data set you like and call it `m1`. In addition to being an object of class `lm`, it is, more fundamentally a named list.
    1. Extract the names of the elements in the list.
    1. Extract the model coefficients in two ways: dollar-sign notation and square bracket notation by name. Are the results different? If so, how?
    1. Use the `summary()` method on `m1` to create a new list and call it `s1`. Extract the names of the elements of this list.
    1. Extract the `coefficient` element of `s1`. What is its type? Its class?
    1. Using the fact that "Everything in R is a vector", use single bracket vector subsetting to extract the p-value corresponding to the slope coefficient.
