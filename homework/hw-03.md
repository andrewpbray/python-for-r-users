## Functions

1.  The [Laplace
    Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_distribution) is
    a continuous probability distribution with a shape that’s determined
    by a center parameter \(\mu\) and a spread parameter \(b\). Write a
    function that returns the probability density of the Laplace
    distribution evaluated at some real number value `x` and call the
    function `lap_pdf`. Allow the user to pass two optional arguments
    specifying the parameters of the distribution that are otherwise set
    to default values of 0 and 1 respectively. Test out your function at
    a view values of `x` and a couple parameter values to test if it’s
    working the way you expect it to.

2.  Consider the following function:
    
    ``` python
    x = 1
    def f(y):
        return x + y
    ```
    
    1.  Does this function have access to the value of `x` in the global
        namespace even though you haven’t passed it in as an argument?
        Write an analagous function in R and compare the behavior.
    2.  Add a line to the function before the `return` where you
        reassign `x` to have a new value. Does running the function
        change the value that `x` takes in the global namespace? Compare
        this behavior to R.
    3.  Add one more line above the previous one to declare that `x` is
        a global variable (as opposed to a local variable): `global x`.
        How does this change the behavior of the function? Compare it to
        a similar modification in R where you instead reassign `x` with
        the super-assignment operator: `<<-`.

3.  In class I gave an ill-conceived poll that asked you to, “Write a
    function that takes a given string, and outputs it as a single
    string repeated `n` times, each one separated by a `.`.” We saw that
    a naive implementation does not work:
    
    ``` python
    def dotted_print(x, n):
        return print(x * n, sep = ".")
    
    dotted_print("hello", 3)
    ```
    
        ## hellohellohello
    
    The reason is that `x * n` is evaluated first, which smushes the
    repeated strings together to form a single scalar string. With only
    one string there (albeit one with repetitions inside it), `print()`
    has nothing to glue together with a `.`.
    
    You can fix this behavior by being sure that each repeated string
    remains a separate element before getting passed to `print()` and
    that print recognizes each of those elements to be separate. You can
    get there by incorporating two realizations:
    
      - As we’ve seen, you can use `*` and `+` operators with string
        types to repeat and concatenate them. They can also be used on
        list types with a similar functionality. The list type is one
        way to preserve the separation between the repeated strings.
      - The `*` character can also be used before a variable passed to a
        function (this character keeps very busy in Python\!). This can
        be read to mean, “expand this as a sequence” (see p. 43 in
        *Whirlwind*). If you look in `?print`, this allows you to pass a
        compound data structure not as a single `value`, but as multiple
        values that take advantage of the `...`.
    
    Use these ideas to fix `dotted_print()`.

## Methods

1.  Consider the following list of strings:
    
    ``` python
    l = ["my", "it's", "smokey", "out"]
    ```
    
    1.  Query two attributes of this string that are of interest to you.
    2.  Use the `.append()` list method to add the string `"today"` to
        this list.
    3.  Use list comprehension (see Lab 2) and string methods to
        capitalize each of the words in this list.
    4.  Construct one addition list comprehension that uses a string
        method of your choice and asserts a logical condition for the
        operation using the `if` keyword.

2.  One of the most common places that you’ll find object-oriented
    programming in R is in print methods. Any time you type the name of
    a variable at the console, it often doesn’t actually print out the
    value of that object, but rather calls on it’s appropriate print
    method.
    
    1.  Create a linear model object using `lm()` (you’re welcome to use
        the `mtcars` example from the slides) and call it `m1`. What is
        the class of `m1`? What is its type (use `typeof()`)? What do
        you get when you print it to the console by either just typing
        the of the object or using `print()`? Compare that with what you
        get if you print the object using `print.default()`.
    2.  Run the `summary()` of the model object and save it as `s1`.
        Answer the same questions as above for `s1`.
    3.  Create a ggplot object and save it as `p1`. Answer the same
        questions as above for `p1` and also look at the help file for
        `print.ggplot()`.
