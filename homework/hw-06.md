1.  At this point, we’ve seen a slew of different data structures in
    Python and R. It’s worth taking a moment to sit down and lay them
    out in a manner that hopefully reveals their similarities and
    differences.
    
    Construct a visual represention of the properties and relationships
    between the data structures in both languages. This could take the
    form of a [mind map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) or a
    [flowchart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart), or whatever
    other representation that you think best conveys the picture. You
    may want to start with a draft to try out your layout before
    spending time on the final version. You can use any technology you
    like: pencil and paper, powerpoint, R (there is a useful package
    called `diagrammer`), etc., but include a picture of the final
    version in your Rmd/pdf document.
    
    Include the following data structures:
    
    **Python**: list, tuple, dictionary, numpy array, pandas series,
    pandas dataframe.
    
    **R**: atomic vectors, matrix/array, list, data frame, tibble.

2.  In lecture we demonstrated how you can build a pandas dataframe from
    a dictionary, but looked at fairly well-behaved examples. Consider
    the following dataframe and describe what rules pandas appears to
    rely upon to turn an unruly dictionary into a dataframe. Some
    suggestions for things to try:
    
      - Query the types of the columns of a dataframe using the
        `.dtypes` attribute.
      - Like an array, you can check shape with `.shape`.
      - Try pulling the resulting dictionary apart with subsetting and
        checking `type()`.

<!-- end list -->

``` python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [[1, 2, 3], 'foo', [], [3, 4]], 'B': 1})
print(df)
```

    ##            A  B
    ## 0  [1, 2, 3]  1
    ## 1        foo  1
    ## 2         []  1
    ## 3     [3, 4]  1

3.  In addition to building dataframes from dictionaries, you can also
    build them from arrays. Convert the following arrays from homework 5
    into dataframes and use them to provide examples as you answer the
    following questions.

<!-- end list -->

``` python
    import numpy as np
    A = np.array([1])
    B = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    C = np.array([[4],
                  [5],
                  [6]])
    D = np.array([[4, 1],
                  [5, 0],
                  [6, 1]])
```

  - What happens when you convert an array into a dataframe? How can you
    add row and column names? (try looking through `dir()` as well as
    consulting the textbook/internet)
  - What happens when you add an array to a dataframe that share the
    same shape?
  - What happens when you add two dataframes that do not share the same
    shape? Consider both cases: different number of rows and different
    number of columns.

<!-- end list -->

4.  The last problem of the previous homework had you standardize random
    normally distribution data using z-scores. Repeat that exercise, but
    work with `X` as a dataframe with variables/columns called X1, X2,
    X3, and X4.
