## Comments on Assignments

1.  Be sure your code is visible in your pdf (no overflowing lines).
2.  If you get at least 2/3 of the points, you get credit on the assignment.
3.  Please tag the pages to the questions, including multiple pages for a single question.
4.  Don't forget to read thoroughly to find the question.

Example of a question requiring code and a written answer:

> 5.  Repeat the exercise but print out the first four values of both `dest` and `origin` but pass them as a list into the square brackets. Try also passing only `dest` as a list. In general, what happens when you subset the columns with a string versus with a list?

```{python}
flights[["dest", "origin"]].head(4)
flights[["dest"]].head(4)
# subsetting with a string with yield a series; with a list yields a data frame
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reading / Writing Data

Let's return to the example of county level data from presidential elections between 2000 and 2016.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewpbray/python-for-r-users/master/data/uselections.csv"
uselections = pd.read_csv(url)
View(uselections)
?uselections
```

Useful arguments to keep an eye out for:

1.  `sep`: what is each data field separated by (can also use `delimiter`)
2.  `header`: which row number has the columns names (or `none`)
3.  `names`: list of columns names to use
4.  `dtype`: dictionary of colname: type pairs for each column.
5.  `index_col`: column to use as row labels when indexing.

To *write* a data frame to a .csv file, use `df.to_csv()` .

## String Methods

Whenever you find yourself wanting to do operations on columns that contains strings, consider the methods available to you.

```{python}
uselections["county"].str
dir(uselections["county"].str)
uselections["county"].str.swapcase()
```

When you append `.str` to a Series, the methods available will operate element-wise down the columns.

#### Question 1

How many counties are called "Districts"?

```{python}
sum(uselections["county"].str.contains("District"))
```

#### Question 2

Return a new data frame that removes all rows containing data from a "District".

```{python}
uselections[uselections["county"].str.contains("District")]
```

#### Question 3

Which counties have the greatest number of words in them? (recall that you can apply a normal function over an interable using `.apply`)

```{python}
split_counties = uselections["county"].str.split()
n_words = split_counties.apply(len)
new_df = pd.DataFrame({"county": uselections["county"], "n_words": n_words})
new_df.sort_values("n_words", ascending = False).head(25)
```

## Joins

Joins come into play when we want to utilize variables that are stored across multiple rectangular data files. Consider the following two mock data frames that each contain a different variable, `x` or `y`.

```{python}
df_1 = pd.DataFrame({"id": [1, 2, 3], "x":["x1", "x2", "x3"]})
df_2 = pd.DataFrame({"unique_id": [1, 2, 4], "y":["y1", "y2", "y4"]})
df_1
df_2
```

We can collect the observations that have been made on both the `x` and `y` variable using `.merge()`.

```{python}
df_1.merge(df_2)
```

```{python}
?pandas.DataFrame.merge
```

This is an example of an **inner join**. It's one of the four most common database-style data joins. The remaining three are examples of *outer joins*, and they generally result in more rows in the resulting data frame, but often induce missing values.

1.  **Left Join**: Keeps everything in the "left" data frame and add on columns containing any additional data in the "right" data frame.

    ```{python}
    df_1.merge(df_2, how = "left")
    ```

2.  **Right Join**: Keeps everything in the "right" data frame and add on columns containing any additional data in the "left" data frame.

    ```{python}
    df_1.merge(df_2, how = "right")
    ```

    Note that this is pretty much the same result as a left join with "left" and "right" swapped.

    ```{python}
    df_2.merge(df_1, how = "left")
    ```

3.  **Outer Join**: Also known as a full join. Keeps any row found at least one in the two data sets and fills in whatever columns of data are available.

    ```{python}
    df_1.merge(df_2, how = "outer")
    ```

#### Question 4

Bring in 2015 county-level demographic data from the `choroplethr` package.

```{r}
# install.packages("choroplethr")
library(choroplethr)
data(df_county_demographics)
```

Using this data, create a scatterplot of each counties percent vote in favor of Hillary Clinton as a function of their per capita income. Construct the scatterplot with ggplot2 but do the data wrangling in Python.
