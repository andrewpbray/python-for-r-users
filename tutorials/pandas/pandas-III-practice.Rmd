```{python py-setup}
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewpbray/python-for-r-users/master/data/uselections.csv"
uselections = pd.read_csv(url)
```

### Question 1

How many counties are called "Districts"?


### Question 2

Return a new data frame that removes all rows containing data from a "District".


### Question 3

Which counties have the greatest number of words in them? (recall that you can apply a normal function over an interable using `.apply`)


### Question 4

Bring in 2015 county-level demographic data from the `choroplethr` package.

```{r}
# install.packages("choroplethr")
library(choroplethr)
data(df_county_demographics)
```

Using this data, create a scatterplot of each counties percent vote in favor of Hillary Clinton as a function of their per capita income. Construct the scatterplot with ggplot2 but do the data wrangling in Python.
