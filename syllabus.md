Python for R Users
================

This course is designed for students who are adept at using R to analyze
data and are looking to expand their toolbox by gaining familiarity with
Python. The emphasis will be on learning Pythonâ€™s capacity to do data
science, both as an analog to R and as a distinct language with
particular strengths and weaknesses.

### Course Communication

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is
highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates
and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the me, I encourage you to
post your questions on Piazza.

### Grading

This is a 1 unit Credit/No Credit class. Your assessment is based on two
items:

**Homework (33%)**: Simple practice assignments that serve to cement
your familiarity with the basic aspects of coding in Python. There will
be a homework following each lecture and they will generally be due on
gradescope by 8pm Wednesday. These will be graded on a credit/no credit
basis.

**Lab (67%)**: More involved analyses due on gradescope 8pm Sunday.
These will be graded on a scale of check minus (needs improvement),
check (fine), check + (excellent).

To get credit for the course, you must get credit for 2/3 of homeworks
and get at least a check on 2/3 of the labs.
