# Review: Writing functions

## Python

```{python, eval = FALSE}
a = [1, 3, 5]
def victorious_print(object):
    return print(object, end = "victory!")
victorious_print(a)
```

--

```{python, echo = FALSE}
a = [1, 3, 5]
def victorious_print(object):
    return print(object, end = "victory!")
victorious_print(a)
```

--

## R

```{r eval = FALSE}
victorious_print <- function(object) {
  paste(object, "victory!")
}
victorious_print(py$a)
```

--

```{r echo = FALSE}
victorious_print <- function(object) {
  paste(object, "victory!")
}
victorious_print(py$a)
```

---
# Methods

--

*Methods* are functions associated with an object. A particular kind of object is called a *class*.

--

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/oop-cars.png")
# from: https://www.viralpatel.net/object-oriented-programming-with-javascript/
```

--

- Class: car
- Objects: VW Beetle, Ford Escort, Buick Landyacht, etc
- All of these have their own associated *attributes* and *methods*.

---
# Attributes vs Methods

*Attributes* are properties that distinguish one instance of an object from others in its class. *Methods* are functions specific to that class that take the object as an argument.

--

## Car attributes
- Make
- Model
- Year of Manufacture

--

## Car methods
- Drive
- Brake
- Fill with gas


---
# Object-oriented Programming in R

--

Consider what happens when I use `plot()` in two different scenarios.

--

```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.height=4}
x <- rnorm(100)
plot(x)
```

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4}
x <- rnorm(100)
plot(x)
```

---
# Object-oriented Programming in R

Consider what happens when I use `plot()` in two different scenarios.

--

```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.height=4}
m1 <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)
plot(m1)
```

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4}
m1 <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)
plot(m1)
```


---
# Object-oriented Programming in R

--

```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.height=4}
class(m1)
class(x)
```

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4}
class(m1)
class(x)
```

---
# Why learn about classes and methods?

--

1. Object oriented programming is a fundamentally different approach to writing software than functional programming. Understanding OOP can help you navigate the Python software that you use.

--

2. In future projects, you might find cases where it makes more sense to conducting your analysis in an OOP framework instead of a functional framework.


---
# Defining a class: starting simple

Define the class name and associate a single datum.

--

```{python}
class car:
  make = "honda"
 
```

--

This makes available a *constructor* function, `car()`, which creates an *instance* of this object called `my_car`.

--

```{python make_mycar, eval = FALSE}
my_car = car()
my_car.make
```

--

```{python ref.label = "make_mycar", echo = FALSE}
```


---
# Defining a class: adding attributes

Instead of hardcoding the attribute of our object, we can allow it to be passed when the instance is *initialized*.

--

```{python}
class car:
  def __init__(self, make = "honda"):
    self.make = make
 
```

--

- `__init__()` is a method that is called whenever your create a new instance of an object.
- `self` references the newly created instance.
- Analogy: if the *constructor* is the factory that stamps out cars, `__init__` is where you can specify the factor default settings.


---
# Defining a class: adding attributes

Instead of hardcoding the attribute of our object, we can allow it to be passed when the instance is *initialized*.

```{python}
class car:
  def __init__(self, make = "honda"):
    self.make = make
 
```

```{python make_def, eval = FALSE}
my_car = car()
my_car.make
```

--

```{python ref.label = "make_def", echo = FALSE}
```

--

```{python make_toyota, eval = FALSE}
my_car = car(make = "toyota")
my_car.make
```

--

```{python ref.label = "make_toyota", echo = FALSE}
```


---
# Defining a class: modifying attributes

```{python}
my_car = car(make = "toyota")
my_car.make
```

Attributes can be modified by referring to that object using the dot notation and setting it to a new value.

--

```{python make_buick, eval = FALSE}
my_car.make = "buick"
my_car.make
```

--

```{python make_buick, echo = FALSE}
```

(inspect object in environment)

---
# Defining a class: adding more attr.

```{python}
class car:
  def __init__(self, make = "honda", model = "civic", 
               year = 2007, mpg = 30):
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year
    self.mpg = mpg
 
```

--

Test it out:

```{python}
your_car = car(make = "toyota", model = "corolla",
               year = 2012, mpg = 35)
your_car.year
```


---
# Defining a class: adding methods

*Attributes*: The "data" that defines the state of a given instance of that class.

*Methods*: Functions that are associated with that class; things the class can *do*.

--

   1. Some methods create output that access attributes.
   2. Some methods create output that access attributes and new arguments.
   3. Some methods modify the attributes of the object (a.k.a. change its state, mutate it).

--

**Question**: What would be a useful method for our `car` that accesses its attributes?

---
# Defining a class: adding methods (1)

```{python}
class car:
  def __init__(self, make = "honda", model = "civic", 
               year = 2007, mpg = 30):
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year
    self.mpg = mpg
 
  def greet(self):
    print("Hello, I am a " + self.make + " " + self.model + ".")

```

--

```{python}
my_car = car()
my_car.greet()
```

---
# But wait!

We can improve this by realizing that each attribute is itself an instance of a particular class, with methods at its disposal. (inspect object)

--

```{python eval = FALSE}
type(my_car.make)
dir(my_car.make)
```

--

```{python toupper, eval = FALSE}
my_car.make.capitalize()
```

--

```{python ref.label = "toupper", echo = FALSE}
```


---
# Defining a class: adding methods (1)

```{python}
class car:
  def __init__(self, make = "honda", model = "civic", 
               year = 2007, mpg = 30):
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year
    self.mpg = mpg
 
  def greet(self):
    print("Hello, I am a " + self.make.capitalize() + 
          " " + self.model.capitalize() + ".")

```

--

```{python}
my_car = car()
my_car.greet()
```


---
# Defining a class: adding methods (2)

```{python}
class car:
  def __init__(self, make = "honda", model = "civic", 
               year = 2007, mpg = 30):
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year
    self.mpg = mpg
 
  def greet(self, name):
    print("Hello, I am a " + self.make.capitalize() + 
          " " + self.model.capitalize() + " and my name is " +
          name + ".")

```

--

```{python}
my_car = car()
my_car.greet(name = "Tic Tac")
```


---

   1. Some methods create output that access attributes.
   2. Some methods create output that access attributes and new arguments.
   
   **3. Some methods modify the attributes of the object (a.k.a. change its state, mutate it).**


---
# Defining a class: adding methods (3)

Let's add an `age()` method that will age the car by `years` and have a corresponding drop in the `mpg`.

--

```{python}
class car:
  def __init__(self, make = "honda", model = "civic", 
               year = 2007, mpg = 30):
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year
    self.mpg = mpg
 
  def age(self, years):
    self.mpg += -years / 4

```

--

```{python mpg1, eval = FALSE}
my_car = car()
my_car.mpg
```

--

```{python mpg1, echo = FALSE}
```


---
# Defining a class: adding methods (3)

Let's add an `age()` method that will age the car by `years` and have a corresponding drop in the `mpg`.

```{python}
class car:
  def __init__(self, make = "honda", model = "civic", 
               year = 2007, mpg = 30):
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year
    self.mpg = mpg
 
  def age(self, years):
    self.mpg += -years / 4

```

--

```{python mpg2, eval = FALSE}
my_car.age(13)
my_car.mpg
```

--

```{python mpg2, echo = FALSE}
```


---
# Practice


---

```{python}
class car:
  def __init__(self, make = "honda", model = "civic", 
               year = 2007, mpg = 30, gas = 12):
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year
    self.mpg = mpg
    self.gas = gas
    
  def drive(self, distance):
    self.gas = self.gas  - distance / self.mpg

```

---

```{python}
my_car = car()
my_car.drive(253)
my_car.gas
```


---
# Adding documentation

Documentation can be done in the class definition by adding *docstrings*.

```{python}
class car:
  """ Create a new car """
  def __init__(self, make = "honda", model = "civic", 
               year = 2007, mpg = 30, gas = 12):
    """ Create a new car with attributes """
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year
    self.mpg = mpg
    self.gas = gas
    
  def drive(self, distance):
    """ Drive a distance (in miles) and deplete the gas """
    self.gas = self.gas  - distance / self.mpg

```

--

```{python eval = FALSE}
?car
my_car = car()
?my_car.drive
?car.drive
```


---
# Defining a class in R

The primary OOP system in R is called S3 and takes a different approach.

--

1. *Attributes* are stored in the instance of the class.

--

2. *Methods* are stored not with the object, but with the a generic version of the function called a *generic*.


---

# Building a constructor

Instead of "defining a class", we build a constructor function to create the instance with its attributes.

--

```{r}
new_car <- function(make = "honda") {
  out <- list(make = make)
  structure(out, class = c("car", "list"))
}
```

--

```{r makecar, eval = FALSE}
my_car <- new_car()
my_car$make
```

--

```{r ref.label = "makecar", echo = FALSE}
```

--

```{r makecar2, eval = FALSE}
my_car$make <- "toyota"
my_car$make
```

--

```{r ref.label = "makecar2", echo = FALSE}
```

---

Let's add back the same attributes into our constructor.

```{r}
new_car <- function(make = "honda", model = "civic",
                    year = 2007, mpg = 30, gas = 12) {
  out <- list(make = make,
              model = model,
              year = year,
              mpg = mpg,
              gas = gas)
  structure(out, class = c("car", "list"))
}
```


---
# Adding methods

Instead of associating the method with the object, S3 objects associate them with a *generic* version of the method. (print code at console)

--

```{r eval = FALSE}
summary
summary.lm
```

--

Note: the arguments of the method must be the exact same as the generic.

---
# Adding a summary method

--

```{r}
summary.car <- function(obj, ...) {
  cat(paste0("Hello, I am a ", obj$make, " ", obj$model, "."))
}
```

--

```{r}
my_car <- new_car()
summary(my_car)
```
