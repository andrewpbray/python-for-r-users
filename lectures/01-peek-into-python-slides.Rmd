# Accessing and installing Python

## How will we access Python?

--

We'll start off using `{reticulate}`, an R package.

--

## Which installation will we use?

--

`miniconda`, a lightweight installation that includes Python and conda, a package management system.

--

> **Poll**: Were you able to install `reticulate` and `miniconda`?

---
# An expanded ecosystem

## Where does `{reticulate}` fit in?

--

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/r-python-diagram.png")
```

--

`{reticulate}` is an R package that starts a Python session within your R session.

---
# Alternatives to {reticulate}

1. Running `python` at the terminal

--

2. Running `ipython` at the terminal

--

3. Running `python` within a Jupyter notebook


---
# Python as a calculator

--

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/math-operators.png")
```

## How does whitespace work?
- 


---
# Whitespace

> **Poll:** Which of the following will throw an error?

```{r whitespace-poll, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# A
a = 1 + 3

# B
a         = 1 +       3

# C
if(a > 2)             {
         
      "so big!"
}

# D
if(a > 2) {
  "so big!"
}
```

---
# Python basics: syntax

## How do you assign objects?
- Assign with `=`

## How do you print?
- `print()` or type name of object

## How do you comment?
- Comments marked by `#`

## How does whitespace matter?
- Yes (indentation) and no (midline)

# Python basics: semantics

## What are variables?

- Variables do not need to be declared
- Variables are *pointers* -> functions can change their arguments.

## What are objects?

- 


---
# John Chambers on S (2008)

> The central computation in R is a function call, defined by the function object itself and the objects that are supplied as the arguments. In the functional programming model, the result is defined by another object, the value of the call. Hence the traditional motto of the S language: **everything is an object**â€”the arguments, the value, and in fact the function and the call itself: All of these are defined as objects. Think of objects as collections of data of all kinds. The data contained and the way the data is organized depend on the class from which the object was generated.

# Python basics: semantics

## What are variables?

- Variables do not need to be declared
- Variables are *pointers* -> functions can change their arguments.

## What are objects?

- Everything is an object: data with *attributes* and *methods*

# A note about {reticulate}


---

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/mic-drop.gif")
```


---
# A note about {reticulate}

`{reticulate}` can pass objects between your Python and R session.

- Python object `b` can be accessed in R using py$b
- R object `a` can be accessed in Python using r.a

# Until next time

- Homework 01 / Lab 01 will be posted by midnight tonight and due Sunday at 8 pm
- Submit work as pdfs to gradescope
