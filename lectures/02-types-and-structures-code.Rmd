# Operators

```{r}
a <- a + 1
`+`(a, 1)
`<-`(a,)
```


## Update

```{python}
a = 2
b = 3

# addition
a += b

# subtraction
a -= b

# multiplication
a *= b

# division
a /= b
```

## Comparison

```{python}
2 < 3
2 <- 3
(2 <- 3) == False
"lo" < "hi
"lo" == "hi"
"lo" != "hi"
```

## Boolean

```{python}
# and
x = 4
(x < 6) and (x > 2)

# boolean algebra
True and True
True and False
False and False

# and is like * of 1 and 0
1 * 1
1 * 0
0 * 0
```

```{python}
# or
(x < 6) or (x > 2)
(x < 6) or (x == 2)

# or is like + of 1 and 0
1 + 1
min(1 + 1, 1)
1 + 0
0 + 0
```

```{python}
(x < 6) | (x > 2)
```

# Sets

```{python}
# equality
a = [1, 2]
b = [1, 2]
a == b
a is b
```

```{python}
# identity
a = [1, 2]
b = a
a == b
a is b
```


# Types

## Integers

```{python}
a = 3
type(a)

# An operation on objects of type integer can yield a non-integer.
3 / 2
```

## Floats

```{python}
# anything with a decimal or in exponential notation
type(3.2)
type(1e6)

# remember floats can only ever be so precise
.1 + .2 == .3
.1 + .2 < .3
.1 + .2 > .3

# don't check for exact equality with floats.
import math
math.isclose(.1 + .2, .3)
```

## Strings

# POLL

```{python}
# creating strings
type("hello")
type('hello')

# some unexpected behavior
a = "hello"
b = " world"
a + b
a - b
a * b
a * 5
a / b
a[2]
```



# Data Structures

## Lists

```{python}
# Create with brackets
a = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
type(a)

# Ordered? Yes
a[1]
a[0]   # uses zero-based indexing
a[-1]  # counts backwards
a[0:1] # use : for slicing
a[:2]  # omitting before implies 0
a[:]    # omitting after implies len(a)
a[::2]

# Mutable? Yes
a.append(1)
a.sort()
a[0] = 99

# note: you can also concatenate two lists
a + [1] # not a mutation since a is unchanged

# what R data structure does this most resemble? a vector?
# Type heterogeneous? Yes
a = [1, "hello", 3.2]
type(a)
a = [1, ["hello", " world"]] # can also be nested
type(a)

# a list!
```

## Tuples

```{python}
# Create with parens
t = (1, 2, 3)
type(t)
t2 = 1, 2, 3
t == t2

# Ordered? Yes
t[0:1]

# notes: nestable
t3 = (1, 2, (4, 5))
type(t3[2])
type(t3[3])

# Mutable? No
t.append(4)
t[0] = 0

# Type heterogeneous? Yes
t = (1, 2, 3, "hello")
type(t)
```

## Sets

```{python}
# created with {}
s1 = {1, 3, 5}
s2 = {1, 2}
type(s1)
type(s2)

# Ordered? No
s1[0]

# Mutable? Yes
s1.append(s2)
s1.add(5)

# note: support set operations
s1 | s2
s1 & s2
s1 - s2
s1 ^ s2
s3 = {1, 3, {1, 3, 5}} # but not nestable

# Type heterogeneous? Yes
s1 = {1, 3, "hello"}
type(s1)
```


## Dictionaries

```{python}
# created with {} and keys
d = {"one":1, "two":2, "three":3}
type(d)

# Ordered? No, but still indexed by key
d["two"]

# Mutable? Yes
d["two"] = 22

# note: can be nested
d2 = {"one":1, "two":2, "three":{"four":4, "five":5}}
type(d2)

# Type heterogeneous? Yes
d["two"] = "hello"
```
