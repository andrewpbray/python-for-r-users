# Operators

```{r}
a <- a + 1
`+`(a, 1)
`<-`(a,)
```


## Update

```{python}
a = 2
b = 3

# addition
a += b

# subtraction
a -= b

# multiplication
a *= b

# division
a /= b
```

## Comparison

```{python}
2 < 3
2 <- 3
(2 <- 3) == False
"lo" < "hi
"lo" == "hi"
"lo" != "hi"
```

## Boolean

```{python}
# and
x = 4
(x < 6) and (x > 2)

# boolean algebra
True and True
True and False
False and False

# and is like * of 1 and 0
1 * 1
1 * 0
0 * 0
```

```{python}
# or
(x < 6) or (x > 2)
(x < 6) or (x == 2)

# or is like + of 1 and 0
1 + 1
min(1 + 1, 1)
1 + 0
0 + 0
```

```{python}
(x < 6) | (x > 2)
```

# Sets

```{python}
# equality
a = [1, 2]
b = [1, 2]
a == b
a is b
```

```{python}
# identity
a = [1, 2]
b = a
a == b
a is b
```


# Types

## Integers

```{python}
a = 3
type(a)

# An operation on objects of type integer can yield a non-integer.
3 / 2
```

## Floats

```{python}
# anything with a decimal or in exponential notation
type(3.2)
type(1e6)

# remember floats can only ever be so precise
.1 + .2 == .3
.1 + .2 < .3
.1 + .2 > .3

# don't check for exact equality with floats.
import math
math.isclose(.1 + .2, .3)
```

## Strings

# POLL

```{python}
# creating strings
type("hello")
type('hello')

# some unexpected behavior
a = "hello"
b = " world"
a + b
a - b
a * b
a * 5
a / b
a[2]
```


# Data Structures

## Lists

```{python}
# Create with brackets
a = [1, 3, 5]
type(a)

# Lists are mutable
a.append(2)
a
a + 2
a + [2]
a.sort()
a
```

```{python}
# so what R data structure does this most resemble? a vector?
a = [1, "hello", 3.2]
type(a)
a = [1, ["hello", " world"]]
type(a)
# a list!
```

```{python}
# indexing starts at 0
a = [1, 4, 7, 6]
a[1]
a[0]
a[3]

# negative counts backwards
a[-2]
```

```{python}
# slicing
a[1:2] # works between elements
a[:2] # assumes 0
a[::2] # skips by 2 and assumes 0 and len(a)
a[::-1] # takes negative steps

# setting elements
a[0] = 9
a
```

## Tuples

```{python}
# creating tuples
t = (1, 2, 3)
type(t)
t2 = 1, 2, 3
t == t2

# they are immutable
t.append(4)
t[0] = 0
```

## Sets

```{python}
# created with {}
s1 = {1, 3, 5}
s2 = {1, 2}

# unordered
s1[0]

# support set operations
s1 | s2
s1 & s2
s1 - s2
s1 ^ s2
```

## Dictionaries

```{python}
# created with {} and keys
d = {"one":1, "two":2, "three":3}
type(d)

# indexed by key
d["two"]
d["two"] = 22 # mutable
d["two"] = "hello"
```
